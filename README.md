# Programming Fundamentals in C

This repository contains my university coursework and practice from the **Fundamentals of Programming (FunPro)** course, focused on the C programming language, taken as part of General Studies at PUCP.


Although comments in the code are written in Spanish due to the nature of the course, the overall structure and documentation are kept in English for accessibility and professional consistency.
